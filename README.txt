Hi Team, Good day!

OVERVIEW: 
    This project is about end-to-end testing for Million More page
    In this project I have done few automation testcases such as 
        1. Verifying all links in the particular page
        2. Content check for all sections
        3. CSS check such as width and height of the web elements
        4. Video functionalities 
        5. Element visibility check for all the web elements
        6. Visual test which will compage each and every UI elements with base screenshots. 

HOW TO EXECUTE:
    Pull from the github
    Command: npm install                #to pull all necessary dependency

    Command: docker-compose up          #to pull docker image
    Command: npm run test               #to run all the testcase
    Command: docker-compose down        #to stop running docker image

    Once the execution is done it will open Allure Reports in the browser tab where can see our test results

Best regards,
Ashokkumar GM.
